    <h1>₰ An Article about Desert</h1>
    <img src="desert.jpg" id="pic">
    <p>A desert is a barren area of landscape where little precipitation occurs and, consequently, living conditions 
        are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to
        the processes of denudation. About one-third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes
        much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or "cold deserts".
        Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification
        or by their geographical location.</p>
      <p>Deserts are formed by weathering processes as large variations in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks which
          consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods.
          Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor are further eroded
          by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object
          in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand
          or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists
          of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops,
          exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground
          sources of water in the form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.</p>
        <p>Plants and animals living in the desert need special adaptations to survive in the harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves,
            water-resistant cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die in the course of a few weeks after rainfall while other
            long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to
            survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of
            their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again during the
            rare rainfall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.</p>
